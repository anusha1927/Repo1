		<p>
			Both the tags <strong>(< div > and < span >)</strong> are used to
			represent the part of the webpage, < div > tag is used as block part of
			the webpage and < span > tag is used as a inline part of the webpage.

			the web page like (text, images, header, footer, navigation bar, etc).

			and content. It used to group elements for styling purposes (by using the
			class or id attributes).
